# 📱 Udemy React Native Course Project

A clean and scalable React Native project built during the Udemy React Native course.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project follows a **Layered Architecture** approach that helps keep the code organized, modular, and scalable by separating concerns such as:

- ⚛️ Core Components  
- 📋 List Optimization (FlatList, SectionList performance)  
- 📐 Responsive UI using Dimension helpers  
- 🚦 Navigation with React Navigation  
- 🌐 State Management (Zustand)  
- 🏋️ Practice Project 1 (Hands-on implementation)  
- 🧱 Dependency Injection for easy testing and reusability  
- ⚡ API Optimization for better performance  
- ✅ Form Validation (Yup / Formik or custom solution)  
- 🔐 Third-party Authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)  
- 📱 QR Code Scanner Integration  
- 🛡️ Secure Data Handling (e.g., AsyncStorage encryption)
- 🏋️ Practice Project 2 (Hands-on implementation)
